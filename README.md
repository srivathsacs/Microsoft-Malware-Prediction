# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.
